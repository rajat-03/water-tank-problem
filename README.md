# Water Tank Problem Visualization

This project visualizes the water storage problem, demonstrating how water can accumulate between walls of varying heights. The application takes user input, processes the heights, and displays two tables:

- **Table with Walls and Water** - Displays both walls and water units.
- **Table with Water Only** - Displays only the water units (no walls).

---

## How It Works

### Input:
The user provides a **comma-separated list of integers** representing the heights of walls.

### Output:
1. A table representing walls and water units.
2. A table showing only the accumulated water.
3. The total amount of water stored between the walls is displayed below the tables.
